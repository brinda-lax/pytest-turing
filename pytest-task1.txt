🔍 Your Test Breakdown
Here's your test function:

python
Copy
Edit
def test_neighborhood_with_biggest_price_diff():
    data = {
        'host_is_superhost': ['t', 'f', 't', 'f'],
        'neighbourhood_cleansed': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B'],
        'price': ['$100.00', '$80.00', '$300.00', '$100.00']
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    # Function call
    result = neighborhood_with_biggest_price_diff(df)

    # Assertion
    assert result == 'B'
🧠 What is this testing?
You're testing a function called neighborhood_with_biggest_price_diff(df).

Expected behavior:
You want to check which neighborhood (A or B) has the biggest price difference.

💰 Price Differences
Neighborhood A:
Prices: $100.00, $80.00 → Convert to numbers → 100.0, 80.0

Price difference: 100 - 80 = 20

Neighborhood B:
Prices: $300.00, $100.00 → 300.0, 100.0

Price difference: 300 - 100 = 200

Therefore:
Neighborhood B has a bigger price difference than A.

✅ Why it Passed:
Your function must have returned 'B', and the assertion checks:

python
Copy
Edit
assert result == 'B'
Since it matched → test passed!

❌ If the function was wrong:
Suppose it returned 'A' instead, the assertion would fail:

python
Copy
Edit
assert 'A' == 'B'  # False
Then pytest would show a red ❌ failure and something like:

java
Copy
Edit
AssertionError: assert 'A' == 'B'
🔁 In Summary
pytest ran your function and checked whether the output was 'B'.

'B' is correct because it has the bigger price difference.

If your function ever returns the wrong neighborhood, the test will fail and catch the bug!
